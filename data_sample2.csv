M6qZU16SjXoyoLrmNENhQg,You order at the counter and they bring the food.,,,
M6qZU16SjXoyoLrmNENhQg,I wish we had one of these where I live.,,,
Wjcm9kzfQp3d2R6uqblzzg,I usually go to pei wei regularly and am usually over all satisfied.,,,
Wjcm9kzfQp3d2R6uqblzzg,However today did not go well .,,,
Wjcm9kzfQp3d2R6uqblzzg,"First I was unable to order online,   when I  went to pick up the food I brought  a gift card with a remaining credit on it and the remaining total written on top with a permanent marker which would have covered the entire cost of my meal.",,,
Wjcm9kzfQp3d2R6uqblzzg,When I handed it over to the employee  she swiped the card and simply stated there is a zero balance on this card.,,,
Wjcm9kzfQp3d2R6uqblzzg,To which I replied that can't be correct because the last time I used it the employee wrote the available balance on the top of the card for me.,,,
Wjcm9kzfQp3d2R6uqblzzg,The cashier didn't seem to take me serious and simply asked for another method of payment.,,,
Wjcm9kzfQp3d2R6uqblzzg,I was in a rush it was my lunch hour so  I paid out of pocket.,,,
Wjcm9kzfQp3d2R6uqblzzg,The sauce on my food taste watered down over all a poor experience.,,,
Wjcm9kzfQp3d2R6uqblzzg,To add insult to injury I later called the number on my gift card and they assured me that I did have a credit balance which leave's me wondering what are gift card's good for?,,,
Wjcm9kzfQp3d2R6uqblzzg,BUYER BEWARE...,,,

69kni-xG6qtg9y3Hq_zw5g,This location is the best Don Tequila I have been to.,,,
rQOasxLFCDNWLNW27VHnyA,Been dining here since it first opened.,,,

eGtRHSII_uNGVELSxjYNSA,We ordered the Guadalajara special tamale and the pollo adobe and they were both delicious.,,,
O5UfgCBj4osaEeolc_muUA,Kind of disappointed with the previous reviews in the area of customer service because honestly there was none.,,,
O5UfgCBj4osaEeolc_muUA,We were the only patrons in the restaurant and the waiter seemed  inconvenienced by us being there.,,,
O5UfgCBj4osaEeolc_muUA,After he took our order he went and sat down in another booth and started playing on a computer.,,,
O5UfgCBj4osaEeolc_muUA,"We did not get our food quickly like everyone else has said, as we were the only people here it shouldn't take as long as it takes for me to finish my beverage.",,,
O5UfgCBj4osaEeolc_muUA,Maybe it had something to do with the fact that the waiter was farting around instead of doing his job?,,,
O5UfgCBj4osaEeolc_muUA,They got three stars because despite the service the food was AMAZING and quite inexpensive.,,,
O5UfgCBj4osaEeolc_muUA,If you order a quesadilla you may want to order a la carte items as well because the quesadilla was the size of a large Taco which is odd.,,,
Dq7iR4uVsVWPfqKqaLtmtw,"I eat here all the time and most of the staff are from Guadalajara.... Food is definately ""americanized"" and by that i mean tamed down in heat and changed a little for what americans expect....",,,
Dq7iR4uVsVWPfqKqaLtmtw,But when i order my racos de carne asada with lime and cilantro and onions.... All i get are big smiles and HOT sauce....,,,
Dq7iR4uVsVWPfqKqaLtmtw,So if your in the mood for authentic hotmexican food.... Just let the waiter know.. Hell guide you to a great choice!,,,
H4ecwTdoO_sjwELf62BjwQ,"Inconsistent service, average food.....I've had better at Chipotle.....Won't be back.",,,
0IOu6FA2x-rcvtXb8Xvheg,Always the same old bad Mexican food.,,,
0IOu6FA2x-rcvtXb8Xvheg,At least this time I did not get the nearly 2 foot piece of hair in my Fajita Burrito.,,,
0IOu6FA2x-rcvtXb8Xvheg,"Why many people I know, including my wife like to go to this place is beyond me.",,,
ysv7Ynllze9TV3GkzF0D3g,"Very good, reasonable priced .",,,

DmVaJHiNO21faYMc74YegQ,Amazingly good Mexican food but they rip you off EVERY time.,,,
DmVaJHiNO21faYMc74YegQ,They scratch your order on a piece of paper with no descriptions and prices never add up.,,,
DmVaJHiNO21faYMc74YegQ,Its ALWAYS more.,,,
DmVaJHiNO21faYMc74YegQ,We have checked this several tines and wrote down everything we ordered and the prices on the menu and its been 20-30% higher consistently every time.,,,
